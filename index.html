            <p>Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 - c. April 5, 1994) was an American musician who was the co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana.
                 Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock.
                  He was heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is highly recognized as one of the most influential alternative rock musicians.</p>

                    <h2>Career</h2>
                    <p>On his 14th birthday on February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitar; Kurt chose the guitar. Soon, he was trying to play Led Zeppelin's song "Stairway to Heaven".
                        He also learned how to play "Louie Louie", Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust", and the Cars' "My Best Friend's Girl", before he began working on his own songs.
                        Cobain played left-handed, despite being forced to write right-handed.
                        
                        In early 1985, Cobain formed Fecal Matter after he had dropped out of Aberdeen High School.
                        One of "several joke bands" that arose from the circle of friends associated with the Melvins, it initially featured Cobain singing and playing guitar, Melvins drummer Dale Crover playing bass, and Greg Hokanson playing drums.
                        They spent several months rehearsing original material and covers, including songs by the Ramones, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix. Until he finally came up with his own record hits.</p>

          <h2>Life and Death</h2>
           <p>Throughout most of his life, Cobain had chronic bronchitis and intense physical pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. According to The Telegraph, Cobain had depression.
              His cousin brought attention to the family history of suicide, mental illness and alcoholism, noting that two of her uncles had died by suicide with guns.
              He used drugs heavily; his first drug experience was with cannabis in 1980, at age 13. He regularly used the drug during adulthood.
              Cobain also had a period of consuming "notable" amounts of LSD, as observed by Marander, and was prone to alcoholism and solvent abuse.
              
              Following a tour stop at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany, on March 1, 1994, Cobain was diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis. He flew to Rome the next day for medical treatment, and was joined there by his wife, Courtney Love, on March 3.
              The next morning, Love awoke to find that Cobain had overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol. Cobain was rushed to the hospital and was unconscious for the rest of the day. After five days, Cobain was released and returned to Seattle.
               Love later said that the incident was Cobain's first suicide attempt.
               On April 8, Cobain's body was discovered at his Lake Washington Boulevard home by an electrician, who had arrived to install a security system.
                A suicide note was found, addressed to Cobain's childhood imaginary friend Boddah, that stated that Cobain had not "felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music, along with really writing ... for too many years now".
                Cobain's body had been there for days; the coroner's report estimated he died on April 5, 1994, at the age of 27.</p>
